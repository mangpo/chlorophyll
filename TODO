TODO
* better hueristic: consider frequency
* iterative partition
- reuse memory space (variables of different loops that are not on stack at the same time)
- inline
- clustered array and function
- optimize MD5 more

REORGANIZATION
- forth-interpreter: merge dev with master, and make dev master
- hardcoded path in forth-interpreter cache
- greensyn: make dev master
- planet forth-interpreter

MISC
- data type check (x[i] + y) when y is array
- visitor-divider can't handle nested indexes (eg. +@place(x[i*n+j]))
- test for-array-fancy.cll

FASTER PARTITIONER
- infer each function first (see issue about racket)
* iterative feedback for MD5
  = call rohin's compiler to get program size
    + if size > 64 words -> define-repeating-code for shorter seq
  = connect to rohin's interpreter
    + left, right, up, down
    + 0 , 0 , 0 ,

ISSUE ABOUT RACKET
- incremental solving not working
- branch debug

MEMO
- same VarDecl => same sym-place!!!

BENCHMARKS
* faster sqrt
- matrix multiply
- insertion sort
- mergesort (function, recursion)
- disparity
- transpose
- DP (activity scheduling)
- fibonacci 
- shortest path
- MST
- DFS, BFS
- heap
- blackscholes (float, log, exp)
- FFT
